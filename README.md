# Investigating-Byssinosis-Infections

Byssinosis(brown lung) is a lung disease that affects people who work in the textile industry. This disease is rare and is associated with inhaling industrial particles, like cotton dust and raw flax. For this project, we investigate Byssinosis’ occurrence within a large cotton textile company in North Carolina. We are interested in Byssinosis’ relationship with other working categorical characteristics, such as smoking and race. We also construct a logistic model that can predict whether a worker has Byssinosis or not.

The data is in the Byssinosis.csv file
